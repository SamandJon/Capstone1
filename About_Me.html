    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
     I have had a passion for technology since I can remember. 
     I have always had a blast figuring out how to figure out different technical things I could do on a PC. 
     I then decided to take a job as a IT support tech at amazon, and have been off to the races ever since.
     I have grown alot already in the two years I've been here.
     I plan on learning lots more and putting my programming skills to the test, once I learn enough.
